# Building with Active Record

The project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").

In this mini-project, I implemented basic model for users, posts and comments as well as their associations and validations. All model interactions are done via rails console.

## Technologies

- Ruby 2.6.3
- Rails 5.2.3

## Usage

> Clone the repository to your local machine

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ebukaume/micro-reddit.git
```

> cd into the directory

```sh
$ cd micro-reddit
$ bundle install
$ rails db:migrate
```

> You can then drop into rails console to explore the models

```sh
$ cd rails c
```
